SomebullshitthatIjuststarted
Oh you know its just a bunch of crap that I wanted to start writing in here. I actually saw a friend post ion their facebook wall about "GIT Fork" and I was all, that , "that can't be that hard to do" so I started Git Hub. Maybe I'll do something with this, maybe I won't.
